SoftUART Echo

This example application utilizes the SoftUART to echo text.  The SoftUART
is configured to use the same pins as the first UART (connected to the FTDI
virtual serial port on the evaluation board), at 115,200 baud, 8-n-1 mode.
All characters received on the SoftUART are transmitted back to the
SoftUART.
