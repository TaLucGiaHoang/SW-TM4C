Interrupts

This example application demonstrates the interrupt preemption and
tail-chaining capabilities of Cortex-M4 microprocessor and NVIC.  Nested
interrupts are synthesized when the interrupts have the same priority,
increasing priorities, and decreasing priorities.  With increasing
priorities, preemption will occur; in the other two cases tail-chaining
will occur.  The currently pending interrupts and the currently executing
interrupt will be displayed on the display; GPIO pins D0, D1 and D2 will
be asserted upon interrupt handler entry and de-asserted before interrupt
handler exit so that the off-to-on time can be observed with a scope or
logic analyzer to see the speed of tail-chaining (for the two cases where
tail-chaining is occurring).
