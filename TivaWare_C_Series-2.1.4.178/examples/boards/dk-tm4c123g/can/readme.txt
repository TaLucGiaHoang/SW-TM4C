CAN Example

This example application utilizes CAN to send characters back and forth
between two boards. It uses the UART to read / write the characters to
the UART terminal. It also uses the graphical display on the board to show
the last character transmited / received. Error handling is also included.

CAN HARDWARE SETUP:

To use this example you will need to hook up two DK-TM4C123G boards
together in a CAN network. This involves hooking the CANH screw terminals
together and the CANL terminals together. In addition 120ohm termination
resistors will need to be added to the edges of the network between CANH
and CANL.  In the two board setup this means hooking a 120 ohm resistor
between CANH and CANL on both boards.

See diagram below for visual. '---' represents wire.

      CANH--+--------------------------+--CANH
            |                          |
           .-.                        .-.
           | |120ohm                  | |120ohm
           | |                        | |
           '-'                        '-'
            |                          |
      CANL--+--------------------------+--CANL

SOFTWARE SETUP:

Once the hardware connections are setup connect both boards to the computer
via the In-Circuit Debug Interface USB port next to the graphical display.
Attach a UART terminal to each board configured 115,200 baud, 8-n-1 mode.

Anything you type into one terminal will show up in the other terminal and
vice versa. The last character sent / received will also be displayed on
the graphical display on the board.
