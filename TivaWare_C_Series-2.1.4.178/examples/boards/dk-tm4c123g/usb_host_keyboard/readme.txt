USB HID Keyboard Host

This example application demonstrates how to support a USB keyboard
attached to the evaluation kit board.  The display will show if a keyboard
is currently connected and the current state of the Caps Lock key on the
keyboard that is connected on the bottom status area of the screen.
Pressing any keys on the keyboard will cause them to be printed on the
screen and to be sent out the UART at 115200 baud with no parity, 8 bits
and 1 stop bit.  Any keyboard that supports the USB HID BIOS protocol
should work with this demo application.
