USB Generic Bulk Device

This example provides a generic USB device offering simple bulk data
transfer to and from the host.  The device uses a vendor-specific class ID
and supports a single bulk IN endpoint and a single bulk OUT endpoint.
Data received from the host is assumed to be ASCII text and it is
echoed back with the case of all alphabetic characters swapped.

A Windows INF file for the device is provided on the installation CD and
in the C:/ti/TivaWare_C_Series-x.x/windows_drivers directory of TivaWare
releases.  This INF contains information required to install the WinUSB
subsystem on WindowsXP and Vista PCs.  WinUSB is a Windows subsystem
allowing user mode applications to access the USB device without the need
for a vendor-specific kernel mode driver.

A sample Windows command-line application, usb_bulk_example, illustrating
how to connect to and communicate with the bulk device is also provided.
The application binary is installed as part of the ``TivaWare for C Series
PC Companion Utilities'' package (SW-TM4C-USB-WIN) on the installation CD
or via download from http://www.ti.com/tivaware .  Project files are
included to allow the examples to be built using 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.  Source code for this application can be
found in directory ti/TivaWare_C_Series-x.x/tools/usb_bulk_example.
