SD card using FAT file system

This example application demonstrates reading a file system from an SD
card.  It makes use of FatFs, a FAT file system driver.  It provides a
simple command console via a serial port for issuing commands to view and
navigate the file system on the SD card.

The first UART, which is connected to the USB debug virtual serial port on
the evaluation board, is configured for 115,200 bits per second, and 8-N-1
mode.  When the program is started a message will be printed to the
terminal.  Type ``help'' for command help.
