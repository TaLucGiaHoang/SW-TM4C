Boot Loader ethernet Demo

An example to demonstrate the use of remote update signaling with the
flash-based Ethernet boot loader.  This application configures the Ethernet
controller and acquires an IP address which is displayed on the screen
along with the board's MAC address.  It then listens for a ``magic packet''
telling it that a firmware upgrade request is being made and, when this
packet is received, transfers control into the boot loader to perform the
upgrade.

This application is intended for use with flash-based ethernet boot
loader (boot_emac).

The link address for this application is set to 0x4000, the link address
has to be multiple of the flash erase block size(16KB=0x4000).
You may change this address to a 16KB boundary higher than the last
address occupied by the boot loader binary as long as you also rebuild the
boot loader itself after modifying its bl_config.h file to set
APP_START_ADDRESS to the same value.

The boot_demo_flash application can be used along with this application to
easily demonstrate that the boot loader is actually updating the on-chip
flash.
