Nine Axis Sensor Fusion with the MPU9150 and Complimentary-Filtered
DCM

This example demonstrates the basic use of the Sensor Library, TM4C1294
LaunchPad and SensHub BoosterPack to obtain nine axis motion measurements
from the MPU9150.  The example fuses the nine axis measurements into a set
of Euler angles: roll, pitch and yaw.  It also produces the rotation
quaternions.  The fusion mechanism demonstrated is a complimentary-filtered
direct cosine matrix (DCM) algorithm. The algorithm is provided as part of
the Sensor Library.

This example requires that the BOOSTXL-SENSHUB be installed on BoosterPack
1 interface headers.  See code comments for instructions on how to use
BoosterPack 2 interface.

Connect a serial terminal program to the LaunchPad's ICDI virtual serial
port at 115,200 baud.  Use eight bits per byte, no parity and one stop bit.
The raw sensor measurements, Euler angles and quaternions are printed to
the terminal.  An LED begins to blink at 1Hz after initialization is
completed and the example application is running.
