Pressure Measurement with the BMP180

This example demonstrates the basic use of the Sensor Library, the
EK-TM4C1294XL LaunchPad, and the SensHub BoosterPack to obtain air pressure
and temperature measurements with the BMP180 sensor.

SensHub BoosterPack (BOOSTXL-SENSHUB) must be installed on BoosterPack 1
interface headers.

Instructions for use of SensorHub on BoosterPack 2 headers are in the code
comments.

Connect a serial terminal program to the LaunchPad's ICDI virtual serial
port at 115,200 baud.  Use eight bits per byte, no parity and one stop bit.
The raw sensor measurements are printed to the terminal.  The LED
blinks at 1 Hz once the initialization is complete and the example is
running.
