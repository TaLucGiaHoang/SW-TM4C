Humidity Measurement with the SHT21

This example demonstrates the basic use of the Sensoror Library, TM4C1294XL
LaunchPad and SensHub BoosterPack to obtain temperature and relative
humidity of the environment using the Sensirion SHT21 sensor.

This example requires that the SensHub BoosterPack is installed on
BoosterPack 1 interface headers on the LaunchPad.  See the code comments for
information on porting this to use BoosterPack 2.

Connect a serial terminal program to the LaunchPad's ICDI virtual serial
port at 115,200 baud.  Use eight bits per byte, no parity and one stop bit.
The humidity and temperature as measured by the SHT21 is printed to the
terminal.  An LED will blink to indicate the application is running.
