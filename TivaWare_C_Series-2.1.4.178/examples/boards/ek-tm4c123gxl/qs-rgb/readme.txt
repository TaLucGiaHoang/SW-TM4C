EK-TM4C123GXL Quickstart Application

A demonstration of the Tiva C Series LaunchPad (EK-TM4C123GXL)
capabilities.

Press and/or hold the left button to traverse towards the red end of the
ROYGBIV color spectrum.  Press and/or hold the right button to traverse
toward the violet end of the ROYGBIV color spectrum.

If no input is received for 5 seconds, the application will start
automatically changing the color displayed.

Press and hold both left and right buttons for 3 seconds to enter
hibernation.  During hibernation, the last color displayed will blink
for 0.5 seconds every 3 seconds.

The system can also be controlled via a command line provided via the UART.
Configure your host terminal emulator for 115200, 8-N-1 to access this
feature.

- Command 'help' generates a list of commands and helpful information.
- Command 'hib' will place the device into hibernation mode.
- Command 'rand' will initiate the pseudo-random color sequence.
- Command 'intensity' followed by a number between 0 and 100 will set the
brightness of the LED as a percentage of maximum brightness.
- Command 'rgb' followed by a six character hex value will set the color.
For example 'rgb FF0000' will produce a red color.
