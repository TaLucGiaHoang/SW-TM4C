USB Generic Bulk Device

This example provides a generic USB device offering simple bulk data
transfer to and from the host.  The device uses a vendor-specific class ID
and supports a single bulk IN endpoint and a single bulk OUT endpoint.
Data received from the host is assumed to be ASCII text and it is
echoed back with the case of all alphabetic characters swapped.

A Windows INF file for the device is provided on the installation CD and
in the C:/ti/TivaWare-for-C-Series/windows_drivers directory of TivaWare C
series releases.  This INF contains information required to install the
WinUSB subsystem on Windowi16XP and Vista PCs.  WinUSB is a Windows
subsystem allowing user mode applications to access the USB device without
the need for a vendor-specific kernel mode driver.

A sample Windows command-line application, usb_bulk_example, illustrating
how to connect to and communicate with the bulk device is also provided.
The application binary is installed as part of the ''Windows-side examples
for USB kits'' package (SW-USB-win) on the installation CD or via download
from http://www.ti.com/tivaware .  Project files are included to allow
the examples to be built using Microsoft VisualStudio 2008.  Source code
for this application can be found in directory
TivaWare-for-C-Series/tools/usb_bulk_example.
