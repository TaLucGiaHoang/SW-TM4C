USB HID Gamepad Device

This example application turns the evaluation board into USB game pad
device using the Human Interface Device gamepad class.  The buttons on the
board are reported as buttons 1 and 2.  The X, Y, and Z coordinates are
reported using the ADC input on GPIO port E pins 1, 2, and 3.  The X input
is on PE3, the Y input is on PE2 and the Z input is on PE1.  These are
not connected to any real input so the values simply read whatever is on
the pins.  To get valid values the pins should have voltage that range
from VDDA(3V) to 0V.  The blue LED on PF5 is used to indicate gamepad
activity to the host and blinks when there is USB bus activity.
