FreeRTOS Example

This application demonstrates the use of FreeRTOS on Launchpad.

The application blinks the user-selected LED at a user-selected frequency.
To select the LED press the left button and to select the frequency press
the right button.  The UART outputs the application status at 115,200 baud,
8-n-1 mode.

This application utilizes FreeRTOS to perform the tasks in a concurrent
fashion.  The following tasks are created:

- An LED task, which blinks the user-selected on-board LED at a
  user-selected rate (changed via the buttons).

- A Switch task, which monitors the buttons pressed and passes the
  information to LED task.

In addition to the tasks, this application also uses the following FreeRTOS
resources:

- A Queue to enable information transfer between tasks.

- A Semaphore to guard the resource, UART, from access by multiple tasks at
  the same time.

- A non-blocking FreeRTOS Delay to put the tasks in blocked state when they
  have nothing to do.
