Graphics Library Demonstration

This application provides a demonstration of the capabilities of the
TivaWare Graphics Library.  A series of panels show different features of
the library.  For each panel, the bottom provides a forward and back button
(when appropriate), aint32_t with a brief description of the contents of the
panel.

The first panel provides some introductory text and basic instructions for
operation of the application.

The second panel shows the available drawing primitives: lines, circles,
rectangles, strings, and images.

The third panel shows the canvas widget, which provides a general drawing
surface within the widget hierarchy.  A text, image, and application-drawn
canvas are displayed.

The fourth panel shows the check box widget, which provides a means of
toggling the state of an item.  Four check boxes are provided, with each
having a red ``LED'' to the right.  The state of the LED tracks the state
of the check box via an application callback.

The fifth panel shows the container widget, which provides a grouping
construct typically used for radio buttons.  Containers with a title, a
centered title, and no title are displayed.

The sixth panel shows the push button widget.  Two columns of push buttons
are provided; the appearance of each column is the same but the left column
does not utilize auto-repeat while the right column does.  Each push button
has a red ``LED'' to its left, which is toggled via an application callback
each time the push button is pressed.

The seventh panel shows the radio button widget.  Two groups of radio
buttons are displayed, the first using text and the second using images for
the selection value.  Each radio button has a red ``LED'' to its right,
which tracks the selection state of the radio buttons via an application
callback.  Only one radio button from each group can be selected at a time,
though the radio buttons in each group operate independently.

The eighth and final panel shows the slider widget.  Six sliders
constructed using the various supported style options are shown.  The
slider value callback is used to update two widgets to reflect the values
reported by sliders.  A canvas widget near the top right of the display
tracks the value of the red and green image-based slider to its left and
the text of the grey slider on the left side of the panel is update to show
its own value.  The slider on the right is configured as an indicator
which tracks the state of the upper slider and ignores user input.
