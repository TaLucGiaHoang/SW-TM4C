Font Viewer

This example displays the contents of a TivaWare Graphics Library font
on the DK board's LCD touchscreen.  By default, the application shows a
test font containing ASCII, the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana alphabets,
and a group of Korean Hangul characters.

The use of LCD BoosterPack (BOOSTXL-K350QVG-S1) requires resistors R9 and
R10 to be removed from the EK-TM4C123GXL Launchpad.
