Motion Air Mouse

This example demonstrates the use of the Sensor Library, TM4C123G LaunchPad
and the SensHub BoosterPack to fuse nine axis sensor measurements into
motion and gesture events.  These events are then transformed into mouse
and keyboard events to perform standard HID tasks.

Connect the device USB port on the side of the LaunchPad to a standard
computer USB port.  The LaunchPad with SensHub BoosterPack enumerates on
the USB bus as a composite HID keyboard and mouse.

Hold the LaunchPad with the buttons away from the user and toward the
computer with USB Device cable exiting the right and bottom corner of the
board.

- Roll or tilt the LaunchPad to move the mouse cursor of the computer
up, down, left and right.

- The buttons on the LaunchPad perform the left and right mouse click
actions.  The buttons on the SensHub BoosterPack are not currently used by
this example.

- A quick spin of the LaunchPad generates a PAGE_UP or PAGE_DOWN
keyboard press and release depending on the direction of the spin.  This
motion simulates scrolling.

- A quick horizontal jerk to the left or right  generates a CTRL+ or
CTRL- keyboard event, which creates the zoom effect used in many
applications, especially web browsers.

- A quick vertical lift generates an ALT+TAB keyboard event, which
allows the computer user to select between currently open windows.

- A quick twist to the left or right moves the window selector.

- A quick jerk in the down direction selects the desired window and
closes the window selection dialog.

This example also supports the RemoTI low power RF Zigbee&reg;&nbsp;human
interface device profile.  The wireless features of this example require the
CC2533EMK expansion card and the CC2531EMK USB Dongle.  For details and
instructions for wireless operations see the Wiki at
