Ethernet Weather Application

This example application demonstrates the operation of the Tiva C series
evaluation kit as a weather reporting application.

The application supports updating weather information from Open Weather Map
weather provider(http://openweathermap.org/).  The application uses the
lwIP stack to obtain an address through DNS, resolve the address of the
Open Weather Map site and then build and handle all of the requests
necessary to access the weather information.  The application can also use
a web proxy, allows for a custom city to be added to the list of cities and
toggles temperature units from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  The application
scrolls through the city list at a fixed interval when there is a valid
IP address and displays this information over the UART.

The application will print the city name, status, humidity, current temp
and the high/low. In addition the application will display what city it
is currently updating. Once the app has scrolled through the cities a
a defined amount of times, it will attempt to update the information.

UART0, connected to the Virtual Serial Port and running at 115,200, 8-N-1,
is used to display messages from this application.
