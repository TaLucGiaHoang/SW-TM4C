<br>
As the first ARM&reg; Cortex&trade;-M4 microcontrollers (MCUs) to be
implemented on TI's proprietary 65-nm process technology, the TM4C Series
provides customers an opportunity to increase their connectivity integration
without sacrificing price, performance, or power consumption. Every TM4C Series
MCU integrates a floating-point core and high-performance analog while still
providing low-power modes to offer a great set of functional options. Today's
engineers understand that designs require more than hardware alone. Often, the
greatest challenge is software and
<a target="_" href="http://www.ti.com/tivaware">TivaWare for C Series</a> is a
free library of C files that include both peripheral-level and
application-level code in source and in ROM for every TM4C Series MCU. This
offering delivers USB, CAN, graphics, and sensor application libraries so
customers can focus their efforts on building applications instead of
programming their connectivity peripherals. The TM4C Series provides an
excellent baseline for home, building, and industrial applications.
