Ethernet with uIP

This example application demonstrates the operation of the Tiva C Series
Ethernet controller using the uIP TCP/IP Stack.  DHCP is used to obtain
an Ethernet address.  A basic web site is served over the Ethernet port.
The web site displays a few lines of text, and a counter that increments
each time the page is sent.

UART0, connected to the ICDI virtual COM port and running at 115,200,
8-N-1, is used to display messages from this application.
