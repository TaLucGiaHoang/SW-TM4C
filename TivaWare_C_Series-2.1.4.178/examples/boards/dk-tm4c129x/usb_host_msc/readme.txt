USB Mass Storage Class Host Example

This example application demonstrates reading a file system from
a USB flash disk.  It makes use of FatFs, a FAT file system driver.  It
provides a simple widget-based interface on the display for viewing and
navigating the file system on the flash disk.

For additional details about FatFs, see the following site:

The application can be recompiled to run using and external USB phy to
implement a high speed host using an external USB phy.  To use the external
phy the application must be built with \b USE_ULPI defined.  This disables
the internal phy and the connector on the DK-TM4C129X board and enables the
connections to the external ULPI phy pins on the DK-TM4C129X board.
