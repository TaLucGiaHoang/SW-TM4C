USB OTG HID Mouse Example

This example application demonstrates the use of USB On-The-Go (OTG) to
offer both USB host and device operation.  When the DK board is connected
to a USB host, it acts as a BIOS-compatible USB mouse.  The select button
on the board (on the bottom right corner) acts as mouse button 1 and
the mouse pointer may be moved by dragging your finger or a stylus across
the touchscreen in the desired direction.

If a USB mouse is connected to the USB OTG port, the board operates as a
USB host and draws dots on the display to track the mouse movement.  The
states of up to three mouse buttons are shown at the bottom right of the
display.
