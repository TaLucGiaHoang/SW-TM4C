USB HID Keyboard Device

This example application turns the evaluation board into a USB keyboard
supporting the Human Interface Device class.  The color LCD display shows a
virtual keyboard and taps on the touchscreen will send appropriate key
usage codes back to the USB host. Modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl and Alt) are
``sticky'' and tapping them toggles their state. The board status LED is
used to indicate the current Caps Lock state and is updated in response to
pressing the ``Caps'' key on the virtual keyboard or any other keyboard
attached to the same USB host system.

The device implemented by this application also supports USB remote wakeup
allowing it to request the host to reactivate a suspended bus.  If the bus
is suspended (as indicated on the application display), touching the
display will request a remote wakeup assuming the host has not
specifically disabled such requests.
