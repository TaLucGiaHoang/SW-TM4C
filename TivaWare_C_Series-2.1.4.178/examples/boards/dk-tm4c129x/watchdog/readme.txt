Watchdog

This example application demonstrates the use of the watchdog as a simple
heartbeat for the system.  If a watchdog is not periodically fed, it will
reset the system.  The GREEN LED will blink once every second to show
every time watchdog 0 is being fed, the Amber LED will blink once every
second to indicate watchdog 1 is being fed. To stop the watchdog being fed
and, hence, cause a system reset, tap the left screen to starve the
watchdog 0, and right screen to starve the watchdog 1.

The counters on the screen show the number of interrupts that each watchdog
served; the count wraps at 255.  Since the two watchdogs run in different
clock domains, the counters will get out of sync over time.
