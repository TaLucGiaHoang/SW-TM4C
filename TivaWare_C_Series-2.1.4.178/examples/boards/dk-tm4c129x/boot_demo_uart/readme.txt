Boot Loader UART Demo

This example demonstrates the use of the ROM-based UART boot loader.  When
the application runs, it will wait for the screen to be pressed (to
simulate an application waiting for a trigger to begin a firmware update)
and then branch to the UART boot loader in the ROM.  The UART is configured
for a baud rate of 115,200 and does not require the use of auto-bauding.
