USB Serial Device

This example application turns the development kit into a virtual serial
port when connected to the USB host system.  The application supports the
USB Communication Device Class, Abstract Control Model to redirect UART0
traffic to and from the USB host system.

The application can be recompiled to run using and external USB phy to
implement a high speed device using an external USB phy.  To use the
external phy the application must be built with \b USE_ULPI defined.  This
disables the internal phy and the connector on the DK-TM4C129X board and
enables the connections to the external ULPI phy pins on the DK-TM4C129X
board.

Assuming you installed TivaWare in the default directory, a
driver information (INF) file for use with Windows XP, Windows Vista and
Windows7 can be found in C:/ti/TivaWare-for-C-Series/windows_drivers.
For Windows 2000, the required INF file is in
C:/ti/TivaWare-for-C-Series/windows_drivers/win2K.
