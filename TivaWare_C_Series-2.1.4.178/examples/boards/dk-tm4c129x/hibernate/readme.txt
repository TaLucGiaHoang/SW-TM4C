Hibernate Example

An example to demonstrate the use of the Hibernation module.  The user
can put the microcontroller in hibernation by touching the display.  The
microcontroller will then wake on its own after 5 seconds, or immediately
if the user presses the RESET button.  External WAKE pin and GPIO (PK5)
wake sources can also be used to wake immediately from hibernation.  The
following wiring enables the use of these pins as wake sources.
    WAKE on J27 to SEL on J37
    PK5 on J28 to UP on J37

The program keeps a count of the number of times it has entered
hibernation.  The value of the counter is stored in the battery backed
memory of the Hibernation module so that it can be retrieved when the
microcontroller wakes.  The program displays the wall time and date by
making use of the calendar function of the Hibernate module.  User can
modify the date and time if so desired.
