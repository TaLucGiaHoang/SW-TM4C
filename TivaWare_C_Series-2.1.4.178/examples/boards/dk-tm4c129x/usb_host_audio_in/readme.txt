USB host audio example application using a USB audio device for input
and PWM audio to the on board speaker for output.

This example application demonstrates streaming audio from a USB audio
device that supports recording an audio source at 48000 16 bit stereo.
The application starts recording audio from the USB audio device when
the "Record" button is pressed and stream it to the speaker on the board.
Because some audio devices require more power, you may need to use an
external 5 volt supply to provide enough power to the USB audio device.

The application can be recompiled to run using and external USB phy to
implement a high speed host using an external USB phy.  To use the external
phy the application must be built with \b USE_ULPI defined.  This disables
the internal phy and the connector on the DK-TM4C129X board and enables the
connections to the external ULPI phy pins on the DK-TM4C129X board.
