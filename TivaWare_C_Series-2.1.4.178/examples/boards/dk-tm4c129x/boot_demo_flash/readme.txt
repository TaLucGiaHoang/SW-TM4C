Flash-based Boot Loader Demo

An example to demonstrate the use of a flash-based boot loader.  At
startup, the application will configure the UART, USB and Ethernet
peripherals, and then branch to the boot loader to await the start of an
update.

This application is intended for use with flash-based ethernet boot
loader (boot_emac_flash).  Although it isn't neccessary to configure USB
and UART interface in this example since only ethernet flash-based boot
loader is provided, the code is there for completeness so that USB or
UART flash-based boot loader can be implemented if needed.
The link address for this application is set to 0x4000, the link address
has to be multiple of the flash erase block size(16KB=0x4000).
You may change this address to a 16KB boundary higher than the last
address occupied by the boot loader binary as long as you also rebuild the
boot loader itself after modifying its bl_config.h file to set
APP_START_ADDRESS to the same value.

The boot_demo_emac_flash application can be used along with this
application to easily demonstrate that the boot loader is actually updating
the on-chip flash.
