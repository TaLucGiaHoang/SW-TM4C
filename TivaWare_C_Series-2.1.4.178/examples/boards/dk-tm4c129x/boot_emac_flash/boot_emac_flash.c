//! <h1>Ethernet flash-based Boot Loader (boot_emac_flash)</h1>
//!
//! The boot loader is a small piece of code that can be programmed at the
//! beginning of flash to act as an application loader as well as an update
//! mechanism for an application running on a Tiva microcontroller,
//! utilizing either UART0, USB, or Ethernet.  The capabilities of the
//! boot loader are configured via the bl_config.h include file.  For this
//! example, the boot loader uses Ethernet to load an application.
//!
//! The configuration is set to boot applications which are linked to run from
//! address 0x4000 in flash.  This is minimal address since the flash erase
//! size is 16K bytes.
//! 
//! Please note that LMFlash programmer version number needs to be at
//! least 1588 or later. Older LMFlash programmer doesn't work with this 
//! Ethernet boot loader.
