FreeRTOS Example

This application utilizes FreeRTOS to perform a variety of tasks in a
concurrent fashion.  The following tasks are created:

* An lwIP task, which serves up web pages via the Ethernet interface.  This
  is actually two tasks, one which runs the lwIP stack and one which
  manages the Ethernet interface (sending and receiving raw packets).

* An LED task, which simply blinks the on-board LED at a user-controllable
  rate (changed via the web interface).

* A set of spider tasks, each of which controls a spider that crawls around
  the LCD.  The speed at which the spiders move is controllable via the web
  interface.  Up to thirty-two spider tasks can be run concurrently (an
  application-imposed limit).

* A spider control task, which manages presses on the touch screen and
  determines if a spider task should be terminated (if the spider is
  ``squished'') or if a new spider task should be created (if no spider is
  ``squished'').

* There is an automatically created idle task, which monitors changes in
  the board's IP address and sends those changes to the user via a UART
  message.

Across the bottom of the LCD, several status items are displayed:  the
amount of time the application has been running, the number of tasks that
are running, the IP address of the board, the number of Ethernet packets
that have been transmitted, and the number of Ethernet packets that have
been received.

The finder application (in tools/finder) can also be used to discover the
IP address of the board.  The finder application will search the network
for all boards that respond to its requests and display information about
them.

The web site served by lwIP includes the ability to adjust the toggle rate
of the LED task and the update speed of the spiders (all spiders move at
the same speed).
