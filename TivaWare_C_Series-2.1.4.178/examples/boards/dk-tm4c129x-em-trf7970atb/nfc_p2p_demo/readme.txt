NFC P2P Demo

This example application demonstrates the operation of the Tiva C Series
evaluation kit with the
TRF7970ATB Evaluation Module
as a NFC P2P device.

The application supports reading and writing Text, URI, and SmartPoster Tags.
The application gets a raw message buffer from the TRF79x0 stack, decodes
the information to recognized tag types, then re-encodes the data to a
buffer to be sent back out. The received tag information is displayed on the
lcd in both a summary screen and a detailed header information screen.
There is also a pulldown screen with buttons to echo the tag back and to
send a webpage link for the evaluation kit. In addition full debug
information is given across the UART0 channel to aid in NFC P2P development.

Please make sure to set the jumpers for the DK-TM4C129x board correctly.
J12, J13 set to EM_UART,
J16, J17 set to SPI
