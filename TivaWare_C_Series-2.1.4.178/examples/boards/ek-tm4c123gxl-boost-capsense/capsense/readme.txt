Capacitive Touch Example

An example that works with the 430BOOST-SENSE1 capactive sense
BoosterPack, originally designed for the MSP430 LaunchPad.

The TM4C123GH6PM does not have the capacitive sense hardware assisted
peripheral features of some MSP430 chips.  Therefore it is required that
the user install surface mount resistors on the pads provided on the bottom
of the capacitive sense BoosterPack.  Resistor values of 200k ohms are are
recommended.  Calibration may be required even when using 200k ohm
resistors as each capsense booster pack varies.  Calibration is required
for resistors other than 200k ohm.

See the wiki page for calibration
procedure.  http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/tm4c123g-launchpad
