Pressure Measurement with the BMP180

This example demonstrates the basic use of the Sensor Library, DK-TM4C129X
and the SensHub BoosterPack to obtain air pressure and temperature
measurements with the BMP180 sensor.

The raw sensor measurements are printed to LCD and terminal.  Connect a
serial terminal program to the DK-TM4C129X's ICDI virtual serial port at
115,200 baud.  Use eight bits per byte, no parity and one stop bit.  The
blue LED blinks every time data is read from the BMP180 sensor.
