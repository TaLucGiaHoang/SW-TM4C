Fuel Tank BoosterPack Measurement Example Application


This example demonstrates the basic use of the Sensor Library, TM4C1294XL
LaunchPad and the Fuel Tank BoosterPack to obtain state-of-charge,
battery voltage, temperature, and several other supported  measurements
via the BQ27510G3 gas gauge sensor on the Fuel tank boosterpack.

The LEDs on the LaunchPad will blink while the application is running.

The Fuel Tank BoosterPack (BOOSTXL-BATTPACK) defaults to be installed on
the BoosterPack 2 interface headers.

Instructions for use of Fuel Tank on BoosterPack 1 headers are in the code
comments.

If you would like to observe how the application affects the voltage or
current readings from the battery, please ensure the POWER_SELECT (JP1)
jumper on the EK-TM4C1294XL LaunchPad is configured for "BoosterPack".

Connect a serial terminal program to the LaunchPad's ICDI virtual serial
port at 115,200 baud.  Use eight bits per byte, no parity and one stop bit.
The raw sensor measurements are printed to the terminal.
