USB Bulk Example (usb_bulk_example)
-----------------------------------

This Windows command line application is written using C for Windows
and should be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.  Project
file usb_bulk_example.vcproj is provided to build the application.

USB communication with the Tiva boards running the usb_dev_bulk sample
application is performed using the LMUSBDLL interface which is a thin wrapper
over the Microsoft WinUSB API.  The relevant WinUSB subsystem files and the
LMUSBDLL.dll are installed when you first connect the board to a Windows host
via USB and install the drivers.  Device drivers for the usb_dev_bulk device
can be found in the windows_drivers subdirectory under
"C:\TI\TivaWare for X Series", where "X" indicates the Tiva series for which
the software was installed.

The LMUSBDLL interface is provided purely to allow the sample applications
to be compiled and run in the absence of the Windows Device Driver Kit
(DDK).  The WinUSB API header and library files are not included in the
Windows SDK shipped with Visual Studio 2008 so any code which uses this
interface requires access to the DDK to build.  LMUSBDLL contains all
the application code requiring WinUSB so applications may link to it
without the need for the Windows DDK.
