            USB Device Firmware Upgrade programming tool
========================================================================

This project contains a simple, Windows command line application which uses
the LMDFU DLL to allow you to program binary images to a USB connected 
device running the Luminary Micro DFU boot loader.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your dfuprog application.

dfuprog.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

dfuprog.cpp
    This is the main application source file.
