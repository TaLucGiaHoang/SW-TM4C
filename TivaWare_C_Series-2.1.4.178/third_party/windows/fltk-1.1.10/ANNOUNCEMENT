The FLTK Team is proud to announce the release of FLTK 1.1.10,
a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11),
Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK provides
modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation.

FLTK 1.1.10 fixes some bugs and updates the bundled png image
library.

This is the final release of the FLTK 1.1.x development tree.

FLTK is provided under the GNU Library Public License with
exceptions that allow for static linking.

Changes since FLTK 1.1.9 include:

	- Updated the bundled libpng to v1.2.35 (released 18 Feb. 2009)
	- Added Fl_Scroll::bbox() documentation (STR #1893)
	- Fixed static linking of image libraries (STR #1962)
	- Fixed callback would not be called when shortcut was used with
          radio and toggle buttons in default FL_RELEASE mode.
	- Fixed a problem with TrackMouseEvent() (Windows only) that would
	  generate wrong FL_LEAVE events with subwindows. TrackMouseEvent
	  is now enabled by default (it was disabled for GNU compilers).
	  It can be disabled by defining NO_TRACK_MOUSE.
	  Improved test/subwindow.cxx (STR #2079)
	- Fixed RGB colors for round box (STR #2097)
	- Fixed documentation (added missing COMCTRL32.LIB dependency)
	- Fl_Group::clip_children() is now public (STR #2017)
	- Fixed first modifier key event (STR #1952)
	- Fixed wrong default value of Fl_Spinner in Fluid (STR #1991)
	- Fixed Fluid textcolor output (STR #1992)
	- Added clarification to Fl_GL_Window mode function (STR #1945)
	- Fl_Group and Fl_Scroll now resize themselves before
	  resizing their children (STR #2032)
	- Fixed adding an idle handler during a draw() call (STR #1950)
	- Improved stability of fl_read_image (STR #2021)
	- Fixed menu position close to screen border (STR #2057)
