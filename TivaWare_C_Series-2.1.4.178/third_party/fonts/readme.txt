This folder contains third party fonts shipped under various licenses
including the Open Font License and Arphic Public License.  Full license
information is included in each subdirectory along with fonts converted for use
with the TivaWare Graphics Library as both C source files and binary files.

For large character sets such as Chinese and Japanese, the C format files may
contain only a subset of characters for illustration purposes.  The very
much larger binary files do, however, contain a full (or at least usable) set
of characters.
