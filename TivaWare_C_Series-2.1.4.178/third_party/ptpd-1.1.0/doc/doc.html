<h1>PTPd Source Code Documentation</h1>

<p>
This is a brief overview of PTPd's source code intended to aid developers looking through PTPd.
</p>

<p> This documentation is incomplete, and it will be worked on as time permits.
More information, particularly on PTPd's clock servo, is available in <a
href="ptpd_2005_1588_conference_paper.pdf">this paper</a> written for the 2005
Conference on IEEE 1588. </p>


<h2>The IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol</h2>

<p> The PTP daemon (PTPd) implements the Precision Time protocol (PTP) as
defined by the IEEE 1588 standard. PTP was developed to provide very precise
time coordination of LAN connected computers. The IEEE 1558 specification
dictates most of PTPd's operation, so one should obtain a copy of the spec
before going through PTPd's source code. PTPd keeps all of the names used in the
spec, so it should be easy to match up PTPd's source code with the spec.
Descriptions herein will assume knowledge of the spec. </p>

<h2>Playing with PTPd</h2>

<p> The best way to become familiar with a program is to use it. One should be
able to run PTPd on standard Linux systems without much trouble. To better
observe the operation of PTPd, compile it with the PTPD_DBG flag to have the
program produce debugging output, and run PTPd with the '-c' argument to prevent
it from backgrounding itself. </p>

<p> PTPd coordinates the local clock by adjusting the effective tick rate, or
<i>slewing</i>, the clock. This is a slow but precise process. To quickly
coordinate a local clock that is off by more than one second, PTPd will reset
the clock instead of slewing. This results in a step change in the time base,
which can can cause problems for applications that require a smooth and
monotonically increasing time base. The '-x' option will prevent PTPd from
resetting the clock, while still allowing it to adjust the clock frequency.
(This is different from the '-t' option that entirely prevents PTPd from
adjusting the clock.)</p>

<p> For PTPd to operate, it must be run on at least two computers connected
through an Ethernet hub or switch. It is possible to have PTPd coordinate two
(and only two) computers through a routed connection by running PTPd on each
computer with the '-u' argument followed by the IP address of the other
computer. </p>

<p> PTPd can send management messages to query PTP nodes on a LAN or a PTPd
server on the same machine. To send a management message, run PTPd with the '-k
NUMBER' option, where the number is the management message key to send, or zero
to send a sweep of different management messages. To query only a local PTPd
server, bind the program to the loopback device with '-b lo'. </p>

<p> PTPd should be able to coordinate the clocks of your computers within tens
of microseconds. The default distribution achieved coordination below ten
microseconds running on fairly busy embedded systems with 66MHz m68k processors.
For the best performance, you will need to tweak the servo gains with the '-a'
command line argument. Also, you must compensate for asymmetric inbound versus
outbound message latency with the '-l' argument. This will remove any constant
offset in the time coordination. As a rule of thumb, you can eliminate a time
offset T by specifying an inbound and outbound latency that have a difference of
2*T. </p>

<p> PTPd's precision is dependent upon the precision of message send and receive
time stamps. PTPd previously required a kernel patch to improve its precision,
but now it needs only a Berkeley sockets interface that has the
<tt>SO_TIMESTAMP</tt> socket option. PTPd uses a few platform specific APIs to
query network interfaces, but otherwise it should be very portable to any Posix
platform that implements David Mills' <tt>ntp_adjtime</tt>/<tt>adtimex</tt>
system call. PTPd runs on Linux, uClinux, NetBSD, and FreeBSD. </p>

<p> While it is fairly easy to get PTPd to provide a precisely coordinated time
base, it is much more difficult to use the coordinated time base. This is
because platforms like Linux do not provide interfaces to generate precisely
timed events. Projects like RTAI are working on 'real-time' turnaround in Linux.
</p>

<h2>PTPd's Source Code Organization</h2>

<p> PTPd's source is grouped into a few components. The component delineations
are based on the functionality defined by the spec, but the delineations are not
specifically defined by the spec. </p>

<p> The following is a block diagram of PTPd's major components, in which
occlusion indicates interfaces between components. </p>

<p><object type="image/svg+xml" data="organization.svg" width="600" height="300">
<a href="organization.svg">[organization block diagram]</a></object></p>

<p> In general, PTPd's source is divided into platform-independent and
platform-dependent code. Platform-independent code is located in the top level
of the PTPd source tree, and platform-dependent code is located the
<tt>dep/</tt> sub-directory. </p>

<p> PTPd's major source code components are: </p>

<dl><dt><b>Protocol Engine</b>, <tt>protocol.c</tt></dt>

<dd> The main protocol state machine defined in the spec. The state machine is
implemented as a forever loop with cases for each state. It is called with
<tt>protocol()</tt> after start-up, and only returns on an error. Normal
execution is expected to be halted externally and asynchronously. The loop
sleeps in a select() call on the network sockets. The primary states, handled by
<tt>doState()</tt>, are master, slave, inactive, and faulty. State transitions,
handled by <tt>toState()</tt>, occur primarily due to the results of the BMC
algorithm. The primary events are message receives, which are checked for in
<tt>handle()</tt>, and timer expiration. The primary actions are message sends,
which are done in <tt>issue()</tt>, timer resets, regular runs of the BMC
algorithm, foreign master data updates, and system clock servo updates after
sync message receipts. </dd>

<dt><b>BMC</b>, <tt>bmc.c</tt></dt>

<dd> The Best Master Clock algorithm defined by the spec. It is called with
<tt>bmc()</tt>, and it returns the proper state, master or slave, based on the
reported clock statistics of other PTP clocks that have sent Sync messages
(foreign masters). </dd>

<dt><b>Clock Servo</b>, <tt>dep/servo.c</tt></dt>

<dd> The clock servo computes the offset-from-master from the master-to-slave
delay and slave-to-master delays. It uses the offset-from-master to compute
clock tick rate adjustments to minimize the offset-from-master. The clock servo
also performs filtering to remove jitter from its input. </dd>

<dt><b>Message Packer</b>, <tt>dep/msg.c</tt></dt>

<dd> Gathers data into and extracts data from PTP messages, the format of which
is defined by the spec. </dd>

<dt><b>Network Layer</b>, <tt>dep/net.c</tt></dt>

<dd> Initializes connections, sends, and receives data between PTP clocks.
The network layer also retrieves time stamps for Event messages from the Time
Stamp component. </dd>

<dt><b>Time Stamp</b></dt>

<dd> Records message send and receive times. The send and receive times are used
to compute the master-to-slave and slave-to-master delay. The delays are then
used to coordinate slave clocks with master clock time. Time stamps should be
recorded as close to the networking hardware as possible. This minimizes jitter
in the time stamps, which is the most significant detriment to PTPd's clock
coordination. </dd>

<dt><b>Timer</b>, <tt>dep/timer.c</tt></dt>

<dd> Low resolution interval timers used in the protocol engine. The timers
control periodic Sync message sends by masters, Delay Request sends by slaves, periodic
runs of the BMC (state change events), and Sync receive timeouts. </dd>

<dt><b>Start-up</b>, <tt>dep/startup.c</tt></dt>

<dd> Sets the program's execution state, and retrieves run-time options from the
user. </dd>

<dt><b>Other code</b></dt>

<dd> The <tt>ptpd.c</tt> file contains the execution entry point. The
<tt>ptpd</tt> header files contain function prototype declarations. The
<tt>datatypes</tt> header files contain structure and data type declarations.
Finally, the <tt>constants</tt> header files contain constant declarations.
</dd></dl>

<h2>PTPd's Clock Servo</h2>

<p> The IEEE 1588 spec does not define how the offset from master produced by a
PTP slave is used to bring the slave clock into coordination with master clock
time. This procedure, called clock discipline, is not trivial, and there are
many possible design approaches and trade-offs. For these reasons, this
documentation devotes a section exclusively to the clock servo component. </p>

<p> The following shows the message send and receive paths in a typical system
running PTPd, along with the associated time stamps that form the basis of the
master-to-slave and slave-to-master delay measurements. </p>

</p>

<p> The following is a system diagram of PTPd's clock servo. The FIR filtering
of the offset from master input is a simple, two-sample average. The IIR
filtering of the input one-way delay is described below. The PI controller that
mediates the tick rate adjustment output has the difference equation: <tt>y[n] =
e[n]/Ap + a[n]</tt>, <tt>a[n] = e[n]/Ai + a[n-1]</tt>. </p>

<p><object type="image/svg+xml" data="clock_servo.svg" width="700" height="250">
<a href="clock_servo.svg">[clock servo system diagram]</a></object></p>

<p> The following are plots of the frequency response of the one-way delay
filter. It is a variable cutoff/delay low-pass, infinite impulse response (IIR)
filter. The one-way delay filter has the difference equation: <tt>s*y[n] -
(s-1)*y[n-1] = x[n]/2 + x[n-1]/2</tt>, where increasing the stiffness
(<tt>s</tt>) lowers the cutoff and increases the delay. </p>
